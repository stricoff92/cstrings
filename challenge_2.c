    CHALLENGE 2
    display your age

    Task:
      Use an integer variable to hold your age.
      Print your age to the terminal using printf and a formatted string;

    Example:
      int almaAgeInMonths = 15;
      printf("alma is %i months old\n", almaAgeInMonths);


    Note:
      To declare a variable you put the type, followed by the variable name.
        Optionally you can assign a value in the same statement.
      Use %i to denote where you want your integer to be placed in the string.
      Pass the integer variable in as the 2nd argument to printf.
