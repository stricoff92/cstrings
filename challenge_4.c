    CHALLENGE 4
    display your name

    Task:
      Use  a cstring variable to hold your name.
      Print your name to the terminal using printf and a formatted string;
      Print the address of the cstring that is holding your name

    Example:
      char* favoriteColor = "blue";
      printf("my favorite color is %s\n", favoriteColor);
      printf("my pointer's address is %p\n", favoriteColor);


    Note:
      The char* type is a pointer to a character. It can also point to an array of characters (c string)
      Use %s to format a char* as a string
      Use %p to format a char* as a pointer (memory address)
