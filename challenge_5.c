    Challenge 5


    Setup:
      create a cstring that holds at least 5 characters

    Task:
      experiment printing your pointer within a formatted string prefixed with a *
      try the different formatting options %i %c %p (ICP FOR LIFE!)

    example:
      char* someData = "hello";
      printf("let's see what happens %i\n", *someData);
      printf("let's see what happens %c\n", *someData);
      printf("let's see what happens %p\n", *someData);

    Discussion Questions:
      what does putting a * infront of a pointer do?
      explain the difference in the terminal outputs when using %i %c %p
      explain the GCC warning

      without running the code, hypothsize what the below code would do
        char* someData = "hello";
        printf("let's see what happens %s\n", *someData);


    $
    gcc challenge_5.c && ./a.out
