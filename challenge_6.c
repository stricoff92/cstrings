    Challenge 6


    Setup:
      create a cstring that holds at least 5 characters

    Task:
      Experiment adding integers to your pointer.
      try formatting as a pointer, integer, character

    example:
      char* someData = "hello";

      printf("let's see what happens %p\n", (someData + 0));
      printf("let's see what happens %p\n", (someData + 1));

      printf("let's see what happens %i\n", (someData + 0));
      printf("let's see what happens %i\n", (someData + 1));

      printf("let's see what happens %c\n", *(someData + 0));
      printf("let's see what happens %c\n", *(someData + 1));

    Question:
      what's happening when we add a number to a pointer?
      what's happening when we add 200 to the pointer? Is there an error? Should there be an error?

    $
    gcc challenge_6.c && ./a.out
