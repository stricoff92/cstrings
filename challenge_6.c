    Challenge 5


    Setup:
      create a cstring that holds at least 5 characters

    Task:
      experiment printing your pointer within a formatted string with a * before the pointer.
      wrap the pointer in parenthasis add 1 to the pointer

    example:
      char* someData = "hello";
      printf("let's see what happens %c\n", *(someData + 1));
      
    Question:
      what's happening in memory when we add 1 to a pointer?
      what's happening when we add 200 to the pointer?
